# AD-SQL-Restore

A PowerShell script that creates an OU (Organizational Unit) in Active Directory and imports users from a csv file and creates a SQL Database and a Table and imports users from a csv file into a SQL Server.

## How to run the script

Run PowerShell ISE as administrator, open the restore.ps1 script and change the server names within the script to reflect your server information before running the script.  You also need to change the csv files to reflect your own unless you are labbing in a test environment and then you can just use the provided csv files as test data.
